## Setup and Installation

The easiest way to access the FROS website is through our live demo link located in the GitHub description. Alternatively, fork and clone `fros-frontend` to your local machine. Since the back end API is hosted on Heroku, there is no need to download and install `fros-backend-api`.

1. Navigate to the main folder of the application.
2. Run `npm install` to install all NPM packages and dependencies.
3. Alternatively, you can also run `yarn install`
4. Run `npm start` to open the application in your browser.
5. Please note: the normal payment information form does not submit or keep track of your personal information.
